# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Tim Hopper!

Welcome to the __Python Developer Tooling Handbook__, a companion to my forthcoming
ebook on Python developer tooling. This handbook covers a wide range of topics,
including build tools, linting, formatting, dependency management, virtual environments,
and more.

## Stay Updated

The book is currently a work in progress, and I'm excited to share it with you when it's
ready. If you want to be notified as soon as it's released, please consider signing up
for my mailing list [here](https://buttondown.email/pdth?tag=github).

## Table of Contents

### Example Python Package Repos

In recent years, Python has evolved its package-building capabilities beyond just
`setup.py` (setuptools/distutils). These modern tools offer a wealth of features and use
cases, which I'll delve into in the book. Each tool enables you to structure a Python
program that can be easily built into a [wheel or
sdist](https://realpython.com/python-wheels/) for sharing on [PyPI](https://pypi.org).

Explore these example repositories to see how these tools can be used:

- [Setuptools with
  setup.py](https://github.com/python-developer-tooling-handbook/demo-setuptools-with-setuppy)
- [Setuptools with pyproject.toml
  only](https://github.com/python-developer-tooling-handbook/demo-setuptools-without-setuppy)
- [Flit](https://github.com/python-developer-tooling-handbook/demo-flit)
- [Poetry](https://github.com/python-developer-tooling-handbook/demo-poetry)
