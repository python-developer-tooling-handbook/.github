# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Tim Hopper!

Welcome to the GitHub compaion to the [Python Developer Tooling Handbook](https://pydevtools.com). This handbook covers a wide range of topics for Python developers,
including build tools, linting, formatting, dependency management, virtual environments,
and more.

### Example Python Package Repos

In recent years, Python has evolved its package-building capabilities beyond just
`setup.py` (setuptools/distutils). These modern tools offer a wealth of features and use
cases, which I'll delve into in the book. Each tool enables you to structure a Python
program that can be easily built into a [wheel or
sdist](https://realpython.com/python-wheels/) for sharing on [PyPI](https://pypi.org).

Explore these example repositories to see how these tools can be used:

- [Setuptools with
  setup.py](https://github.com/python-developer-tooling-handbook/demo-setuptools-with-setuppy)
- [Setuptools with pyproject.toml
  only](https://github.com/python-developer-tooling-handbook/demo-setuptools-without-setuppy)
- [Flit](https://github.com/python-developer-tooling-handbook/demo-flit)
- [Poetry](https://github.com/python-developer-tooling-handbook/demo-poetry)
- [PDM](https://github.com/python-developer-tooling-handbook/demo-pdm)
