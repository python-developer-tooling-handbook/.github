This Github page is a companion to my forthcoming ebook on Python developer tooling
(build tools, linting, formatting, dependency management, etc). 

The book is currently in progress. If you are interested in being notified when it is
released, please sign up for my mailing list

### Example Python Package Repos

In recent years, Python expanded the ability to build packages beyond just `setup.py`
(setuptools/distutils). These tools have a variety of features and uses cases that I
will discuss in the book, but each tool can be used for structuring a Python program
that can be built into a [wheel or sdist](https://realpython.com/python-wheels/) for
sharing on [PyPI](https://pypi.org).  

The following repos are examples of how to build packages using the new tools.

* [Setuptools with
  Setup.py](https://github.com/python-developer-tooling-handbook/demo-setuptools-with-setuppy)
* [Setuptools with pyproject.toml
  only](https://github.com/python-developer-tooling-handbook/demo-setuptools-without-setuppy)
* [Flit](https://github.com/python-developer-tooling-handbook/demo-flit)
* [Poetry](https://github.com/python-developer-tooling-handbook/demo-poetry)
* [PDM](https://github.com/python-developer-tooling-handbook/demo-pdm)
* [Hatch](https://github.com/python-developer-tooling-handbook/demo-hatch)
